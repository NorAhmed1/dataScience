Whenever, we have free variables, we have non-zero dimension null space. This happens when $m>n$. \n",

Second we can use the solutions to $Ax = 0$ for form a null space, which is a subspace. The key point is that the two ways both guarantee that the zero vector is included. For row space and left null space, it is similar. \n",

    "* 1-a. $r=m=n$: $Ax = 0$ only have a solution $x=0$. Or we can understand as the number of free variable is zero and thus null space is only $x=0$.

If $Ax=b$ has solution, then it requires that the $b$ must lie in the $C(A)$. If this is the case, then we have ONE solution. However, it is possible that two column vectors of $A$ cannot linearly combine to any four-dimensional vector $b$. In this later case, there is no solution.\n",
    "* 2-b. Only row full rank (memorize as fat matrix). Imagine a $2\\times4$ matrix. We thus know $C(A)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. As shown in lecture 10, $dim C(A) = dim C(A^T)$, so if there are two independent rows, then there must be two independent columns. Therefore the four columns (two of them are independent) in $A$ can linearly combine into any $b$ vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In other words, we can always find at least one particular solution $x_p$ to $Ax = b$. Now we turn to the solution to $Ax = 0$, i.e., the $N(A)$. The null space dimension is 4-2 = 2 and thus we have two free variables, or have two independent vector in null space. We can obtain the $x_n$, which is linear combination of two $\\mathbb{R}^4$ vectors. Then the final solution will be $x = x_n+x_p$. The key is this fat matrix case, in 2-dimensional space, there are at least two independent column vectors, and thus we can expand any vector $b$, and thus we have at least one particular solution. By the way, the $N(A)$ is a combination of two independent vectors, and thus is a plane in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ space. Finally, from above, the non-zero $N(A)$ and the existing $x_p$ give infinite number of solutions. \n",
    "* 2-c If column is not full rank, it is like the case of 2-b and we may have a particular solution if $b \\in C(A)$. Otherwise no nonzero $x_p$. If row is not full rank, it is like the case of 2-a, we have nonzero $N(A)$ and thus may have infinity number of solution. So in this case, there might be no solution or $\\infty$ solutions.\n",
