    "the big difference between explicit loops and vectorization\n",
    "See more about vectorization in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35091979/why-is-vectorization-faster-in-general-than-loops.  Vectorization uses special hardware. Unlike a multicore CPU, for which each of the parallel processing units is a fully functional CPU core, vector processing units can perform only simple operations, and all the units perform the same operation at the same time, operating on a sequence of data values (a vector) simultaneously. This is not same as the traditional multi-threading.  \n",
