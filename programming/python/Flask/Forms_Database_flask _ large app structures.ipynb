    "* One of the essential aspects of a web application is to present a user interface for the user. HTML provides a `<form>` tag, which is used to design an interface. A Form’s elements such as text input, radio, select etc. can be used appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the form of **Http request message**, data entered by a user is submitted to the server side script by either GET or POST method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Server side script has to recreate the form elements from http request data. So in effect, form elements have to be defined twice – once in HTML and again in the server side script.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another disadvantage of using **HTML form** is that it is difficult (if not impossible) to render the form elements dynamically. HTML itself provides no way to validate a user’s input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is where WTForms, a flexible form, rendering and validation library comes handy. Flask-WTF extension provides a simple interface with this WTForms library.* \n",
    "\n",
    "* Using Flask-WTF, we can define the form fields in our Python script and render them using an HTML template. It is also possible to apply validation to the WTF field."

    "* Sometimes you may want add a column to your created table in python script. However, updating this in python does not automatically update the table in the database. These are called migrate changes to the database table. \n",
    "* We could use Flask-Migrate(already installed) to do this. There are four main commands used in the command line to perform the migration.\n",
    "    * Set FLASK_APP environment variable by **'set FLASK_APP=BasicModelApp.py'**. Note this is just for Flask to know what is your application file. This has nothing to do with the file path. If we did not run the set up above, then Flask will automatically find an application called app.py.  \n",
    "    *  We first set up our migrations directory by running: **'flask db init'**. This creates a migration repository. You only run this command once at the start of you using migrations to manage changes to your database. You should now see a migrations folder with a versions folder. Now we will be able to keep track of changes to the database in case we later decide to update our models. \n",
    "    * Now that the folder has been created and set up, we can create pending migrations based on our current model. Right now our .py file is called BasicModelApp.py, but for larger projects later on we will have this file simply be called models.py. It is time to now use the migrate command, this will create a unique id for the migration. Typically this unique id is just a number code like a437f282d3 , which isn't helpful for trying to remember past changes. So we can add a -m flag which allows us to add a message to our unique id. The next command then will look like this for us: **flask db migrate -m \"created puppy table\"**. \n",
    "    * Keep in mind this command is not actually running this migration or updating our database based on model changes. Its just created a new file that can later be used to update the database. To run the pending migration just created, we use the upgrade command. Which looks like this: **flask db upgrade** \n",
    "    \n",
    "* The above process is very similar to the git commands system. The final one is just like commit command. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Comments: In fact, if the created database is small and easy to create again, we can just delete it and then create it again. This way, we don't have to use the above commands.**"
