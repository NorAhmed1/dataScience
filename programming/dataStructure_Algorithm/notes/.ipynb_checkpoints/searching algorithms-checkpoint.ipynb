    "## Linear search\n",
    "•\tFor simple case for small size array, we can still use linear search.  \n",
    "•\tFor n-size array, if it involves k nested searches, it does not necessarily require worst O(n^k) complexity. We can anyway improve just a little bit. For example, if there are fixed relation between looping indices i, j such as I > j, abs(i-j) < K, etc., then we can save some searching time. See the example in Hash-searching examples. "
