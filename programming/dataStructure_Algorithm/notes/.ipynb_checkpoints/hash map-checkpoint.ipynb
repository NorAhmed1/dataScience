    "* Sometimes vector or other sequential data structure can also be used to implement Hash property, as in the Anagram problem, we use vector(128,0) for hash searching. In this case, it can be even faster because we don't have to use Hash function. \n",

    "# Hash Tables\n",
    "### How Hash Tables work?\n",
    "When coming to how the hash tables work, we talk about three main following things:  \n",
    "* Hash Function - Hash Function is a function which leverages accessing and searching data in the hash table. It could be any algorithm customized and optimized as per a particular scenario. It should be a logic which takes our key as the input, and generally gives out the value corresponding to it in the hash table. However, with the same input key to the logic, output should be same every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key Value Pair - The Key-Value pair is the basic essence of the hash table data structure. For the suited situations, it makes searching really efficient and optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collisions - Collision is when for one key, we have more than one data value to be stored. A hash table would never guarantee that for every key, there would be just one data value corresponding to it. This is because generally a hash table would have a fixed number of keys. Any new entry after the size of hash table has to be accommodated causing the collision. However, a good hash table would always try to avoid collisions and use efficient ways to handle collisions, and at the same time optimize the size of the table. This introduces the tradeoff. This surface outs another important feature of a good hash table which is uniform distribution."
