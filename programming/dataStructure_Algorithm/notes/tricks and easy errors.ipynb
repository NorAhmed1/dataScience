    "### Use multiple returns to avoid ELSE\n",
    "In a function with multiple return sentences or breaks from a loop etc., sometimes I can save some writings on logical structure. For example, if in the beginning of a function we have “if(root == NULL) return;”, then the later code is automatically on the case of root != NULL, and therefore I don’t have to rewrite that later condition. In the example of sameTree judgement, we have:  \n",

    "* Each new recursive function call includes ALL THE STEPS in the recursive function. We need track all these steps and make sure all of them are executed sooner or later (using the way to underscore different numbers as shown below). Usually all steps will not be executed in a single calling frame. Otherwise it is not called a recursive call. \n",

Check the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AGQU0z2wg . In the end, it gives a very nice picture to show the traversal of binary tree. The key trick is: if the recursive function has three steps, then in each node, plot 123. Then after finish one step, put an underscore under that step, until it is done. After practicing the above two visualizations, then the recursive picture will be much clear. \n",
    "* From the binary tree traversal picture, we know that all steps in a function call cannot be executed one after one. Some step can only be executed after the return of other function calls. Check the order how the number 1, 2, 3 in each function call are marked with an underscore.   "
