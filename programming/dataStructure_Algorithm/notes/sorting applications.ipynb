(see the find kth largest element example). Normally we will have a better complexity than O(NlogK). This depends on the complexity of creating a specific ordered data structure.\n",

By keeping updating max1, max2, max3 (and min1, min2 if negative numbers are involved), we can achieve O(N) performance. In fact, it should be O(NlogK). No, it should be O(Nk) complexity. Only when I use priority queue, then it is O(NlogK). See similar results in merge k sorted linked list or array. "

For vectors merging, it seems not easy to merge many pairs using std::merge(). So the appropriate way is to use k-pointers method, which should be OK for both vectors and linked list. Finally, the pair-wise merging has the same O(Nk) time as the k-pointers merging. \n",
