    "I should categorize almost all the algorithms into the following corner stones. Maybe I should say no free lunch. The following all is swap something for something. Sometimes swap complicated calculation (function mapping) and reduce O(n) to O(1). Sometimes swap simple calculation (comparison) for a logN improvement. Sometimes we can also swap space (memory) for time improvement. When this is combined with divide and conquer, we have dynamic programming...."

    "•\tQuick sort. It is typical divide and conquer algorithm. In brute-force sorting, we need compare each value with the whole range of values (thus O(N^2)). However, once we partition the array according to a pivot into two subarrays, then we need only compare a value with only the values in the subgroup (thus O(NlogN)). \n",
